# Home-Interface
A system for controlling home automation and media playback functionality.

> This is an learning venture into object-oriented PHP. It will evolve considerably over time as my understanding improves. It is *not* _recommended_ that you use any of this code, though the license permits this and you are welcome to do so.

## Overview
The exact functionality is to be determined, however the core intent of this project is as follows:
- Provide a responsive web-based user interface (to be run on a kiosk or tablet) for home automation management
- Integrate and control approximately 30 [Philips Hue](https://developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started) devices
- Integrate and control various security devices (IP cameras and alarm sensors)
- Integrate and control audio sources (NAS) and outputs (network-connected speakers)
- Integrate with third party APIs for voice recognition and 'concierge' functionality

## Branches
*public*: The latest 'stable' version suitable for use by others
*local*: The current 'working' version used by myself
*issue__*: Numbered issue branches unlikely to be stable
